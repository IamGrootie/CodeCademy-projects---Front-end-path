<h1 align="center">Project: Mysterious Organism</h1>

This project was created in partership with Mysteryman according to the open-ended [tasks](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-javascript-syntax-part-ii/modules/wdcp-22-mysterious-organism/projects/mysterious-organism)

##

## Project Goal
Context: Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

## [Tasks](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-javascript-syntax-part-ii/modules/wdcp-22-mysterious-organism/projects/mysterious-organism)

1. Generate an array containing 15 bases ('A', 'B', 'C' and 'D') to represent a single DNA
2. Create a factory (*pAequorFactory()*) that returns an object that contains the properties specimenNum and dna that correspond to the parameters provided
3. Add a method that simulates a mutation in a single base of the DNA object
4. Add a method that define the percentage of familiarity between two DNA specimen's
5. Add a last method that defines the likelyhood of survival considering that the chance is high if the DNA is made up at least 60% of 'C' and 'G' bases
6. Create 30 different DNA instance when the likelyhood of survival is above 60%
